# Capstone_Project - Predicting Credit Card Approval using Machine Learning Techniques
# Objective:<br>
   This project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card approval based on various features of the applicant. The project uses a machine learning algorithm to classify whether an application is approved or rejected.Developed a machine learning model capable of predicting credit card approval based on applicant data and minimize human bias in credit card approval decisions.
# Dataset:<br>
The dataset used in this project contains 1548 instances and 19 features. The data is preprocessed by removing missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and scaling the features.
# Models Used:<br>
Various classification models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Naive Bayes are used . The parameters are tuned using hyperparameter tuning and the performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.
# Result:<br>
 A confusion matrix and ROC curve are produced to visualize the model's performance.Resulting in Accuracy of 85%.
